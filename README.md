# EduFundFullStack



### Todo
- Assumptions: (this is just to me, It will be expanded on)
  - Validation
  - Database structure (one to many/millions)
  - Sharing
  - URL
- Tests! : add a testing framework with unit tests and github actions


### Not Included
- Complete git history:
  - Constrained by time.
  - My general workflow is making a branch for a feature and then using Webstorm's internal merge tool to go over changes made on pull. 
  - I've got an auto-fetch tool so I never miss a merge.
