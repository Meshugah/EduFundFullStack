### Not Included
- Complete git history:
  - Constrained by time.
  - My general workflow: 
    - Locally: Making a branch for a feature and then using Webstorm's internal merge tool to go over changes, per file during merge.
    - Github: Push branch and setup github actions to trigger on pull request aand run tests 
  - I've got an auto-fetch tool so I never miss an update.
  
- TDD 
  - Constrained by time.
